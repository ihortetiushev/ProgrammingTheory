# Clean Code Refactoring Examples

Refactoring examples are created to illustrate dirty codes. 

To make the refactoring smooth, all examples are covered by unit tests.

# How to use it
Create a new git branch for each refactoring example. 

To compare differences, I suggest creating incremental commits on the new branch.

# How to contribute
We embrace dirty codes in this project. However, unit tests must be provided for refactoring purpose.
